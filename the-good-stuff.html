    <h1>What is version control?</h1>
    <p>From what I understand, a version control system allows you to keep track and manage changes to a main project, repository, or source 
        code. Different people working remotely can share files from the same project and download the latest version of any file they want. This way they 
        work independently and can later merge their changes with the changes of others, so that the source code can then be updated.
    </p>
    <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages to version control</h2>
    <p>Some advantages include being able to revert back to earlier versions of your code. If you made a mistake today you can go back to the version of the 
        code you had yesterday. You can even go back an entire year to see what changes were made then, in case you've encountered a bug and suspect that bug was
        introduced a while ago. Also, each change that is made is tagged so that it is clear who made the change and when.
        One disadvantage of a version control system is that its performance decreases the larger the project size increases. Another disadvantage
        is that you can't only sync part of a project; you must sync the whole project. Lastly, distributed version control systems are often hard to explain to 
        people who are just learning how to code and use a vcs.
